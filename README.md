Though [Macs Fan Control](https://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control) is not open-source, we use this GitHub repository to track bugs, feature requests and technical support problems (see [issues](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/issues)).

# Translating the app

The repository also contains Macs Fan Control [translations](/languages) as .xml files. Fork the repository, update existing translation (or create a new one) and simply create a pull request. Always leave %1 (%s), %2, etc in the string, it's a replacement pattern required by the program.

# Release archive 

[Release archive](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/releases) contains the list of binaries for every version of the app with release notes.
